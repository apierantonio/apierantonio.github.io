# My view on Open Access 
*Alfonso Pierantonio*

## Open Access help reduce the difficulties in accessing science, not always without a price

Non-open access journals let reader access reasearch outputs through access tolls (such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges) in order to cover publishing costs. Open access (OA) promotes the online distribution of research outputs, free of cost.
