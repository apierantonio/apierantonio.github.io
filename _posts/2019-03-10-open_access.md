# Open Access help reduce the difficulties in accessing science, but who pays?

Conventional wisdom suggests that Open Access (OA) should help reduce the difficulties in accessing knowledge and research products. In fact, research outputs published according to OA can be distributed online free of cost, or other barriers in contrast with traditional (non-open access) journals that requires subscription fees, site licenses or pay-per-view charges. 

## Open Access vs publishing costs

While OA can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, and conference papers, the publishing costs still need to be covered. An **article processing charge** (APC), also known as a publication fee, can be charged to authors to make a work available open access in either an open access journal or hybrid journal to cover organization, review, formatting and archiving expenses.

This gives place to different OA models.

# Open Access Models

## Hybrid Open Access

“Hybrid” open access means that one or more articles in a subscription journal may be open to anyone on the internet even though all the rest of the content is available only to people and institutions with paid subscriptions. This is possible in some journals that offer their authors a choice of paying the APC to make their article freely accessible or leaving it behind the subscription barrier. 

## Green Open Access

“Green” open access occurs when the publisher of a subscription journal allows the author to keep the non-commercial rights to her article so it can be posted in open internet archives.  Archives may be institutional repositories or discipline-specific archives maintained by scholarly associations. In some cases, the publisher requires that open access in the archives be delayed for 6 to 12 months.

A variety of platforms are available, including disciplinary repositories (e.g., [https://arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org), [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)) and institutional repositories hosted by a university or organization. The benefit of green open access for researchers is the avoidance of costs that may otherwise accompany the gold open access model (see below).


## Gold Open Access

“Gold” open access refers to journals in which all articles and content are open access — available to anyone on the internet without any subscription fees or sign-in. Publishers cover the publishing costs by means of the APC, which is charged to authors to make a work available open access. This fee is usually paid by an author's institution or research funder rather than by the author themselves. An article processing charge does not guarantee that the author retains copyright to the work, or that it will be made available under a Creative Commons license (see below).

## Platinum Open Access

"Platinum" (or Diamond) open access means permanent and free access to published scientific works for readers with no publication fees for the authors – 100% free. All articles are published under the most flexible reuse standard – the CC BY license. Publication costs are funded by non-profit associations, academic institutions or governative information centre. Platinum open access platforms maximizes the potential for exchanging ideas and provides a valuable contribution to those with limited financial means by leveling the playing field and giving everyone an equal chance to publish and read scientific publications of high quality. 

# A Controversial change

In Gold OA publications, the APC shifts the burden of payment from readers to authors (or their funders), which creates a new set of concerns: 

* publishers are incentivized to accept anything submitted,
* institutional budgets may need to be adjusted in order to provide funding for the article processing charges required to publish in many open access journals; this aspect might induce
a financial bias since 
	* authors from countries with low incomes may have difficulties in publishing; and 
	* non tenured academic staff might have different access to the institutional funds to pay the processing costs. 

All in all, part of the scientific budget will be shifted from the creation of knowledge to the dissemination of knowledge.

# Problems

Gold OA publications are typically operated on commercial platforms where the burden of payment is shifted from readers to authors (or their funders). Thus, part of the scientific budget devoted to the creation of knowledge will be used for the dissemination of knowledge.

This might put in jeopardy the following aspects:

**Scientific quality:** since commercial publishers are earning on a per published paper basis, they are incentivized to accept papers even though their quality is below a given threshold.

**Financial bias:** authors from countries with low incomes may have difficulties in publishing. Moreover, non tenured academic staff might have different access to the institutional funds to pay the processing costs.
