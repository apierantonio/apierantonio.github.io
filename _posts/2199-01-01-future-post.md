# The hidden side of the debt: how to rescue Europe
## The analysis of the debt-related financial figures drives the public debate across Europe for years. It is time for a new Possible.

The analysis of the debt-related financial figures drives the public debate across Europe for years. Almost without exception politicians and consequently, people assume — whether deliberately or not — a definition of debt that is universal and unambiguous. The Maastricht Treaty formalizes four criteria (article 121) that impose control over inflation, public debt and the public deficit, exchange rate stability and the convergence of interest rates. In particular, debt and central government deficit are particularly monitored. The debt corresponds to the outstanding of liabilities evaluated at the end of a given period, whereas deficit corresponds to the borrowing need observed during the same period.

The debt in the sense of Maastricht [5] is defined in a specific way and consists only of the following  financial liabilities
* cash and deposits,
* treasury bonds (BTF and BTAN),
* é ungible treasury bonds (OAT),
* Euro medium term notes (EMTN), as well as loans.

According to this definition, the debt of the EU Member States is given in Figure 1 with a number of countries that are far beyond the fateful threshold of 60% prescribed by the treaty.

Conventional wisdom suggests that the Mediterranean debt, i.e., the debt of the EU Member States in Southern Europe, is a major problem in the Eurozone that can put the existence of the Euro currency and the EU in jeopardy. However, in 2015 Eurostat for the first time ever produced a report on the liabilities that do not fall under the umbrella of the definition of the Maastricht Treaty.

The newspaper Die Welt, in an article by Von Anja Ettel and Holger Zschäpitz (“Europa sitzt auf einem Berg heimlicher Schulden”) [2], defined such liabilities as the hidden debt — a form of financial wizardry that certain countries pursue “to massage their public accounts and respect official deficit and debt limits.” as depicted by the Financial Times (“Does Germany have a bigger public debt problem than Greece?”) [3].

But how Eurostat defines such hidden debt? here what they say

> Liabilities of government controlled entities classified outside general
> government (public corporations) are defined as the stock of liabilities at
> the end of the year, based on the business accounts of corporations. Those
> government controlled entities are classified outside general government due
> to their behaviour as market units. 

A debt that may become actual government liabilities if specific conditions prevail as stated by Eurostat. In other words, the governments are the guarantee of last resort for such contingent liabilities and non-performing loans. To have an idea about the scale of the problem, please have a look at Figure 2 where the hidden debt for the EU Member States is reported.

Countries, like Germany and Netherlands, often considered the best students in EU classroom, are the most indebted ones when contingent liabilities are considered. In Germany, this is mostly due to the federal architecture that let the Länder (the regional states) and the federal state share concurrent powers, including public health and higher education. This has led to a considerable distribution of public expenditure across layers of government that includes also municipalities, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

In 2015, only the 35% of the overall German expenditure has been under the control of the Bundesrigierung, the rest was administrated by the regional and local authorities.

How the regional authorities can sustain such an expenditure?

The Länder enjoy access to deep and liquid capital markets (stable and inexpensive funding) since they are large customers of their respective Landesbanken in areas including the distribution of public funds. However, Länder have ultimate responsibility for the liabilities of the financial health of financial institutions and municipalities whose liabilities might crystallise on the already burdened balance sheets of the Länder.

A contradicting scenario emerges since

1. because of the definition of the debt in the sense of Maastricht, Länder securities fall outside the treaty;
1. Länder securities are included in the ECB’s public-sector asset purchase programme (which increases demand for securities issued by Länder while lowering borrowing costs).
