Short bio
------
I am Associate Professor at the University of L'Aquila (Italy) and also Visiting Professor at Mälardalen University (Sweden).

My research interests are in Model-Driven Engineering, Language Engineering, and in Software Engineering. In particular, I am interested in any form of co-evolution, in bidirectionality and uncertainty, and most recently I am building a generic modeling platform alternative to EMF/Ecore.

I have published more than 120 papers in international journals, conferences and workshops. 
I am now involved in the following international journals

* [Journal of Object Technology](http://www.jot.fm), Editor-in-Chief
* [Software and System Modelling](http://www.sosym.org/), Editorial Board
* [Science of Computer Programming](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming), Advisory Board

I have been General Chair of STAF 2015 and Program Chair of ECMFA 2018. I am chairing the steering committee of the International Conference on Model Transformation (ICMT) and of the Workshop on Models and Evolution (ME). In the last five years, I (co-)organized about 20 conferences and workshops. I have been member of the Program Board of the 21th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS'17). I have been co-director of the 12th International School on Formal Methods for the Design of Computer, Communication and Software Systems: Model-Driven Engineering held in Bertinoro (Italy), 2012.
