I have developed and delivered modules at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels and I have experience with teaching to both small groups and large cohorts. Modules have been delivered in Computer Science degree programs and in degree programs where Computer Science was not the primary subject. Currently I am delivering the following courses:

* Tecnologie del Web
* Model Drive Engineering
* Advanced Modelling Techniques 

Moreover, I have been chair of the Master in Web Technology since 2004 until 2018.
